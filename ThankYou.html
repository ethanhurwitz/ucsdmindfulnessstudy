                Thank you so much for your participation! This study is investigating the role of cognitive flexibility in contemplative practices.
                It is thought that, through contemplative and mindfulness practices, people are able to develop the ability to be more cognitively flexible. 
                As a result, they are able to reframe or let go of maladaptive narratives and beliefs. The different parts of this study tested different ways 
                someone might be cognitively flexible. The hope is that ultimately these insights can help inform treatment for clinical populations.<br><br>

                If you know of anyone else who engages with a contemplative or mindfulness practice, novice through expert, and especially if they
                have recently been on a retreat, please feel free to forward them information about participating in this study.<br><br>

                We went to extend our deepest gratitude and appreciation to you for participating and helping to make this possible.
                Also to these generous and kind individuals and groups that have helped us with recruitment:
